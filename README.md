# Lil-8
Lil-8 is a stinky minimalistic JS game engine.

The main point of this game engine is to not use variables,
only working with 32 bytes of ram, a tiny stack, and using immediate / constant values.

Of coarse, this is garbage, so u dont have to do it ^-^;;
its just a lil challenge for shits and giggles.

## What can i use it for ?
Dont use it.

If u still wanna, Lil-8 uses a framebuffer type display, and it can display 64 colours identical to the NES pallete.
It has a keyboard interface with buttons:<br>
<kbd>up</kbd>, <kbd>down</kbd>, <kbd>left</kbd>, <kbd>right</kbd>, <kbd>Z</kbd>, and <kbd>X</kbd>.

So youre not gonna make anything special with this.

## ...
yea ... ig ill make some games / demos on it cuz why the hell not ya know.
Oki see ya :D
